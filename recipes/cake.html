    <h3>Method</h3>
    For the cake
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 160°C.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare a 9" round cake pan by lightly greasing with oil, then lining the bottom with a circle of greaseproof
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Sift cocoa powder into
        bowl, then whisk to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 2 large eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl until well combined and creamy, about 30
        seconds. Using a spatula, mix egg mixture into dry ingredients until fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm milk in a small saucepan until it comes to just a bare simmer — make sure it doesn’t come to a boil. Whisk
        warmed milk into batter until lump-free and just combined; do not overmix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately transfer batter to prepared pan. Tap pan a few times on work surface to encourage some of the
        bubbles to escape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake cake until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out with a few damp crumbs, 40–50 minutes.
        Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan.
      </li>
    </ol>
    For the frosting
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop the chocolate into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the cream until a bare simmer, then pour over chopped chocolate. Wait 1 minute then stir until combined. In
        case the chocolate does not fully melt, microwave in short bursts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, whisk (room temperature) cream cheese, powdered sugar, and
        remaining vanilla extract and kosher salt in a large bowl until very smooth and no lumps remain. Beat in cooled
        chocolate ganache on medium speed, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until frosting just holds its peak and
        is well combined and a little thicker, about 1 minute. You don’t want to overbeat because the frosting can
        become too stiff.
      </li>
    </ol>

    Once the cake is fully cooled, remove from the pan and apply the frosting.
